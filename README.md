# EnphaseEnergy

*Enphase changed the authorization with version 7 - you are now required to authorize local access via their cloud server! I can only give one recommendation: do NOT buy Enphase Energy solar systems – access to your data is controlled by them!*

Various collected information about Enphase Energy solar system (I am just starting on this one… But the installer password was highly requested on the web, so I am starting with that one)

- [passwordCalc.py](passwordCalc.py) - sample code to calculate the installer password for a given serial number
- [findEnphaseWithBonjour.py](findEnphaseWithBonjour.py) - sample code to find Enphase Envoy via Bonjour/Zeroconf. This also provides the serial number of the Envoy.
- [enphaseStreamMeter.py](enphaseStreamMeter.py) - sample code to stream production/consumption. Requires the installer password.
